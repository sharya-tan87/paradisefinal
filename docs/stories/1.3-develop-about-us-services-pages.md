## Dev Notes

### UX Design Validation
*(Sally, UX Expert)*

These pages are crucial for building trust and communicating expertise. Consistency with the `HomePage` is key, but the information density requires careful handling.

**1. Page Consistency & Navigation:**
*   **Cohesive Journey:** The user's journey from `Home` -> `About` -> `Services` should feel seamless. The `Header` and `Footer` must be identical across all pages.
*   **Active Navigation State:** It is critical to implement the `NavLink` active state styling as suggested in the `Dev Notes`. This provides a strong visual cue to the user about their current location within the site, which is fundamental for good orientation. The `text-primary-500 font-semibold` style for the active link is a great choice.

**2. About Us Page - Building Trust:**
*   **Information Hierarchy:** The flow of `Mission -> Values -> Team` is logical. Use spacing (`py-16`, `py-20`) to clearly separate these sections.
*   **Team Photos:** Placeholders are fine, but the circular shape (`rounded-full`) is a good choice to create a friendly, approachable feel. The `ui-avatars.com` suggestion is excellent for creating high-quality, consistent placeholders. Let's make that the primary recommendation.
*   **Card Consistency:** The `Values` cards and `Team` cards should share the same core styling (padding, border, shadow, hover effect) to create a consistent visual language on the page. The `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all duration-300` effect should be applied to all cards.

**3. Services Page - Communicating Expertise:**
*   **Scan-ability:** With 6-8 services, this page can become dense. The grid is the correct approach. The use of icons is vital for quick scanning.
*   **Clear Typography:** Ensure a clear hierarchy within the service cards.
    *   `H3` for the service name should be prominent.
    - The description text should be slightly smaller (`text-sm` or `text-base`) and have a comfortable line height (`leading-relaxed`) to make the descriptions easy to read.
*   **"Learn More" affordance:** Even if the "Learn More" links are optional for now, designing the cards to accommodate them is smart. A simple right-arrow icon next to the link text can increase its clickability. Example: `Learn More ->`

**4. Content & Tone:**
*   **Professional & Warm:** The provided example text for the mission and values is excellent. It strikes the right balance between professional and warm. Encourage the dev to use this content.
*   **Bio Length:** Keep team member bios concise (2-3 sentences). Users want a quick snapshot, not a full resume. The examples are perfect.

**5. Responsive Grid Behavior:**
*   **Breakpoint Refinement:** The proposed grid (`1 -> 2 -> 3` columns) is a standard and effective pattern. Pay close attention to the `gap` between cards at each breakpoint. `gap-6` or `gap-8` is a good range to ensure the cards don't feel cramped. On mobile, ensure the single column of cards has sufficient vertical spacing.

By implementing these refinements, the About and Services pages will effectively build user trust, clearly communicate the clinic's offerings, and provide a seamless extension of the brand experience established on the homepage.

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 1.2 - Develop Home Landing Page]

Story 1.2 should have delivered:
- HomePage component with hero section, clinic intro, service highlights
- Minimal Header and Footer components
- Brand-compliant styling with Tailwind
- Responsive design patterns
- Heroicons integration

**Key Learnings to Apply:**
- Use same card styling pattern (white bg, #CEE0F3 border, soft shadow)
- Apply same responsive grid approach (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use Heroicons for visual interest
- Follow same manual testing approach

### Placeholder Images for Team Photos
[Source: General web development practice]

**Options for Team Photos:**
