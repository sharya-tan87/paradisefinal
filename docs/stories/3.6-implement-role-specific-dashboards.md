# Story 3.6: Implement Role-Specific Dashboards

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** User (Admin, Manager, Dentist, Staff),
**I want** to land on a dedicated dashboard route reflecting my role (`/dashboard/manager`, etc.),
**so that** I have a personalized entry point that feels like my own workspace, respecting the role hierarchy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  Dedicated routes exist for each role:
    -   `Admin` -> `/dashboard/admin` (Landing Shell)
    -   `Manager` -> `/dashboard/manager` (Landing Shell)
    -   `Dentist` -> `/dashboard/dentist` (Landing Shell)
    -   `Staff` -> `/dashboard/staff` (Landing Shell)
    -   `Patient` -> `/dashboard/patient` (Existing)
2.  `LoginPage` redirects users to their specific dashboard route upon successful login.
3.  All role dashboards (`/dashboard/admin`, `/dashboard/manager`, etc.) render the main **StaffDashboard** component (Shell), which dynamically displays the correct navigation items based on the user's role and hierarchy level.
4.  Admin Tools page (User Management) is moved to `/dashboard/admin/users` to avoid conflict with the Admin Landing Dashboard.
5.  Navigation links in the Dashboard Shell are updated to point to the correct Admin Tools path.
6.  Role Hierarchy is respected:
    -   Admin sees all tools.
    -   Manager sees Manager + Dentist + Staff tools.
    -   Dentist sees Dentist + Staff tools.
    -   Staff sees Staff tools.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Creating Role-Specific Routes** (AC: 1, 3, 4)
    -   [x] Update `frontend/src/App.jsx`
    -   [x] Rename existing `/dashboard/admin` route to `/dashboard/admin/users` (Admin Tools).
    -   [x] Add `/dashboard/admin` route -> renders `StaffDashboard`.
    -   [x] Add `/dashboard/manager` route -> renders `StaffDashboard`.
    -   [x] Add `/dashboard/dentist` route -> renders `StaffDashboard`.
    -   [x] Ensure `ProtectedRoute` allows appropriate access (e.g., Manager can access `/dashboard/manager`).

- [x] **Task 2: Update Login Redirection** (AC: 2)
    -   [x] Update `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`.
    -   [x] Change redirection logic:
        -   Start by checking specific roles.
        -   Admin -> `/dashboard/admin`
        -   Manager -> `/dashboard/manager`
        -   Dentist -> `/dashboard/dentist`
        -   Staff -> `/dashboard/staff`
        -   Patient -> `/dashboard/patient`

- [x] **Task 3: Update Dashboard Navigation** (AC: 5, 6)
    -   [x] Update `frontend/src/pages/StaffDashboard.jsx`.
    -   [x] Update `navItems`: Change 'Admin Tools' path to `/dashboard/admin/users`.
    -   [x] Verify `navItems` filtering logic works for the new routes (it relies on `localStorage` user role, so it should work automatically).

- [x] **Task 4: Testing & Verification**
    -   [x] Login as Admin -> Lands on `/dashboard/admin`. Sees Sidebar with Admin Tools. Checks Admin Tools link -> works.
    -   [x] Login as Manager -> Lands on `/dashboard/manager`. Sees Sidebar with Manager tools (Analytics, etc.).
    -   [x] Login as Dentist -> Lands on `/dashboard/dentist`. Sees Sidebar with Dentist tools.
    -   [x] Login as Staff -> Lands on `/dashboard/staff`.
    -   [x] Login as Patient -> Lands on `/dashboard/patient`.
