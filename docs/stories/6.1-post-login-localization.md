# Localize Post-Login Pages to Thai

## Context
The application is required to support Thai (TH) as the primary language for all post-login pages, ensuring a fully localized experience for staff and administrators.

## Requirements
1.  **Staff Dashboard**: Localize welcome messages, user roles, and profile information.
2.  **Dashboard Navigation**: Localize all sidebar navigation items.
3.  **Role Names**: Ensure user roles (Admin, Manager, Dentist, Staff, Patient) are translated.
4.  **Admin Tools (User Management)**: Localize the entire user management interface including table headers, filters, buttons, and modals (Create, Edit, Delete, Reset Password).
5.  **Queue Dashboard**: Localize the appointment queue interface, status badges, and related modals.
6.  **Calendar Management**: Localize the calendar view, dentist filters, and appointment modals.
7.  **Patient Records**: Localize the patient list, search, and patient management modals.
8.  **Translation Files**: key-value pairs must be added to `th.json` and `en.json` (as fallback/switchable option).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Translation Configuration
- Used `react-i18next` with `i18n.js` configuration.
- Default language set to `'th'`.

### 2. File Updates
- `frontend/src/locales/th.json` & `en.json`: Added sections for:
    - `staffDashboard`
    - `adminTools`
    - `queueDashboard`
    - `calendarPage`
    - `patientsPage`

### 3. Component Localization
The following components were updated to replace hardcoded strings with `t('key')` calls:
- **Layout**: `frontend/src/components/DashboardLayout.jsx`
- **Dashboard**: `frontend/src/pages/StaffDashboard.jsx`
- **Admin**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminToolsPage.jsx`
- **Queue**: `frontend/src/pages/QueueDashboard.jsx`
- **Calendar**: `frontend/src/pages/CalendarPage.jsx`
- **Patients**: `frontend/src/pages/PatientsPage.jsx`

## Verification
- Validated that all static text on these pages renders in Thai by default.
- Verified that English fallback keys exist.
- Checked that dynamic content (like roles and statuses) is mapped to translation keys correctly.
